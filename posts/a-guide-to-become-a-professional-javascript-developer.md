# Quick peek on your journey
At the beginning it doesn't matter whether you want to become a embedded system engineer, a web dev or want to write scientific code.
Before you even begin to write code, there are things every programmer should know. You'll get to write code soon enough, so why not spend a bit of time on doing it properly:

- [**Git**](https://www.atlassian.com/git)
  is absolutely essential in your everyday work as a programmer. You will have to develope a deep understanding of how commits, branches and PRs work. You should learn [the difference between _rebasing_ and _merging_](#whats-the-difference-between-git-rebase-and-git-merge) and [when to use which](#when-should-you-use-git-rebase-and-when-git-merge) and need to adapt [conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- [**Google**]() is part of your every day job as programmer. You spend a lot of time researching solutions to problems and finding the right resources and skim through large amounts of information.
- [**Stackoverflow**]() is a very important platform which answers 90% of any question you might have about programming. If you struggle with a coding problem. You'll find a solution there. Answering questions on Stackoverflow can be a very helpful coding practice and will advance you a lot in your early years. You can also ask any questions you encounter.
- [**HTML/CSS**]() is a markup language which browsers use to render websites. If you want to build your own website / webapplication from scratch, you need to master HTML and CSS.
- [**JavaScript**]() 
  is the language of modern web applications. You should learn it if you want to become a fullstack or web developer. The great thing about JavaScript is that you can get started immediately without any complicated setup. All you need is a [Browser]().
- [**TypeScript**]() is essential if you want to write code professionally. It's a standard in many companies and will make your life a lot easier.
- [**React**]() is a frontend framework for SPA's it allows you to build modern web applications. Its component based approach allows you to write modular and maintainable code. React is a skill with high market value as it's a very popular framework.
- [**Node.js**]() is JavaScript on the server side. Once you mastered JavaScript on the frontend, you can head over to the backend and write serverside application code using the same language. There are a lot of frameworks you will need to learn and we'll mention them in a seperate post.
- [**Databases**]() you need to learn how relational databases work. You will have to become proficient in SQL and be able to manage a Database.
- [**Docker**]() allows you to run almost anything in a virtualized container. This allows you to easily spawn multiple services like a Database on the same server where other services are running without any overhead of installing things manually.
- [**DevOps**]() You will need basic infrastructure knowledge, how to use docker or kubernetes, azure, google cloud and aws in order to host and run servers.
