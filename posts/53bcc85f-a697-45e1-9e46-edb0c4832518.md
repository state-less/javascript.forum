If you have worked with JS before, you probably came across TypeScript, but why should you learn it?
IMHO you should start with TypeScript ASAP. As a senior dev with experience in both worlds I wish I had learned TypeScript way earlier.

JavaScript has been a language with a lot of controversial opinions. However it made a huge step forward in the past decade and nowadays, JavaScript is all over the place. It's being used in production by mature companies and has widely been adopted by the community.

So what does TypeScript do?
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a superset of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and provides static typing for JavaScript with its own compiler that can be seamlessly integrated into your existing workflow / pipeline and IDE.

It's easy to learn and you'll master the basics in no time while improving the quality of your codebase by an order of magnitude.

Let's take a closer look at the differences between a typed and an untyped language in general:

The benefits outlined in the answer are obvious, but there's more. Nowadays static typing drastically improves developer experience when using a proper IDE like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), by providing autocompletion and auto-imports.

### Quality

Static typing improves the overall quality of your code. The earlier you begin to develop a sense for code quality, the sooner you'll progress in your developer carreer.

I've seen a lot of JS codebases and they all tend to get messy. They often lack basic checks a TS compiler would complain about. Dirty typed code tends to attract bugs which are hard to follow and debug. Combine this with mutation, global and shadowed variables scattered all over and your code becomes a nightmare to debug.

#### Typed code is a lot more readable. It's much more obvious what happens if you're always aware of the shape and flow of data within your code.

The most valuable benefit of a high quality codebase is that it speeds you up 10x all while reducing frustration to a minimum. If you have a codebase that reads like a book, you can easily keep a mental representation of the entire codebase. Bugs tend to become a lot more obvious and most of the times you immediately know where and how you need to fix them. This makes things much more predictable and enables the team to better estimate the effort needed in order to fix a bug. This takes risk out of a project and increases plannability allowing your PO to better align the roadmap with the teams estimation.

Here are a few additional aspects to consider in terms of code quality besides using a typed language:

- Formatting (use a formatter with defined rules, such as [prettier](https://prettier.io/))
- Linting (use a linter with strict rulesets, such as [eslint](https://eslint.org/))
- Write modular, generic and reusable code. ([_KISS_, _DRY_, _YAGNI_](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/principles-clean-code-dry-kiss-yagni-rajnish-kumar/))
- Prefer functional code.
  - Write [pure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) (side-effect free) functions where possible
- Use object oriented code only when neccessary
  - [Don't mutate variables](https://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa15/classes/09-immutability/#:~:text=Mutable%20objects%20reduce%20changeability,example%20to%20illustrate%20the%20point.) / object properties
- Use appropriate techniques / solutions for problems e.g.
  - [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)
  - [Observer / Subscriber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)
  - [Seperation of Concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)
  - [Single Responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)
  - [PubSub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern)
- Use proper naming conventions to aid readability
  - Use explicit and speaking variable names
- Good code reads like a book
- Use version control
  - Use a proper branching model (e.g. [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow))
- Use a type system such as TypeScript
  - Don't use "any" _(see strict eslint ruleset)_
- Keep files small
- Code Review  
  <sub>_Note: It's very important to develop a conventional coding style to which you as a team adhere. Changes / PRs should always be peer reviewed to ensure they meet quality requirements and fulfill your DoD, before they get merged into release._</sub>
- Keep technical debt to a minimum
- Continously refactor (and improve) your code
- Test your code with a tool like cypress
  - Unit tests
  - E2E tests
  - Visual regression tests
- Don't commit sensitive data
- Use environment variables
- Make sure your code is stageable (DEV / UAT / PROD)
- Use CI / CD pipelines

### Mitigate common pitfalls

Using some of these techniques allows you to mitigate a lot of problems which make JavaScript especially difficult for beginners.

#### ASI

Using ESLint you can mitigate common pitfalls with ASI by enabling the [@stylistic/semi](https://eslint.style/rules/default/semi)

#### Weak comparison

A lot of novice JavaScript developers are confused by `===` vs `==`. TypeScript helps you by strongly typing your variables ensuring you will never unintentionally compare two variables of different types.

_Hint: enabling the [eqeqeq](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/eqeqeq) eslint rule which requires `===` also helps keeping this problem away._

### Career

If you're an aspiring frontend or web dev you have to learn TypeScript if you want to become a senior dev.

Most Fullstack / Frontend roles require TypeScript knowledge. It's commonly used in a production setting and many high quality "JavaScript" codebases use TypeScript.

If you're a junior developer I would highly recommend to look for a position where TypeScript is being used. You'll benefit a lot from this experience in the long run.
